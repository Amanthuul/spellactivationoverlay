### Seasonal

This release bumps TOC file for Season of Discovery patch. We need your help! :index_pointing_at_the_viewer:

Head over class channels to discuss which runes you want to see, and share spell IDs, should you have them. Thank you :pray:

## Bug Fixes

### :mage~1:  Mage

Targets affected with the Deep Freeze\* debuff were not considered Frozen.

Fire mages casting four consecutive critical strikes without casting Pyroblast in-between had a false positive Heating Up\*.

\* Wrath Classic only
