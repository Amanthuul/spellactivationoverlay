release-1.5.txt

@here After a long break, I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 1.2.0

This release focuses on Classic Era, mostly Season of Discovery, and a bit of non-seasonal content as well.

Shout-out to @abecks, @Amanthuul and @AboveAzureSkies for their contribution to the code. Thanks!  :person_bowing:

## General

### Seasonal

This release bumps TOC file for the new Season of Discovery content and for Hardcore Self Found.

## Classes

### :druid:  Druid

New Spell Alerts:
- Nature's Grace\*
- Eclipse

New Glowing Buttons:
- Starfire, during Lunar Eclipse
- Wrath, during Solar Eclipse

\* Unlike Wrath, Nature's Grace alert of Classic Era is always blue-ish, to avoid confusion with Fury of Stormrage.

### :mage~1:  Mage

New Spell Alerts:
- Hot Streak
- Missile Barrage\*
- Brain Freeze

\* Missile Barrage has a blue-ish tint to differ from Arcane Blast

New Glowing Buttons:
- Pyroblast, during Hot Streak
- Arcane Missiles, during Missile Barrage
- Fireball, Spellfrost Bolt, and Frostfire Bolt, during Brain Freeze

### :shaman:  Shaman

New Spell Alerts:
- Maelstrom Weapon
- Power Surge

New Glowing Buttons:
- Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Lesser Healing Wave, Healing Wave, Chain Heal, and Lava Burst, during Maelstrom Weapon
- Chain Lightning, Chain Heal, and Lava Burst, during Power Surge

### :warrior:  Warrior

New Spell Alert:
- Bloodsurge

New Glowing Button:
- Slam, during Bloodsurge

## Bug Fixes

### Runes

Runes should now always be detected correctly, up to 10 seconds after login, in the worst case scenario. Previously, there was a bug which, if very unlucky, would not detect runes until logging out and logging back in.


As always, the latest release is available:
- on CurseForge ðŸ‘‰  https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spellactivationoverlay

## Classes

### :druid:  Druid

New Spell Alerts:
- Nature's Grace\*
- Eclipse

New Glowing Buttons:
- Starfire, during Lunar Eclipse
- Wrath, during Solar Eclipse

\* Nature's Grace was already supported in Wrath, and is now supported on Classic Era.
In Wrath, players can choose between a blue-ish and green-ish texture. The green-ish texture is the one from Fury of Stormrage.
Era players cannot select the texture, because selecting the green-ish one would conflict with Fury of Stormrage.
Fury of Stormrage does not exist in Wrath, so Wrath players can still select their preferred texture for Nature's Grace.
