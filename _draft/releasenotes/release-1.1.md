@here I am hyped to announce the beta release of SpellActivationOverlay v1.1.0!

Due to high demand, there is an 'official beta' release for those of you eager to play Season of Discovery as soon as possible. Enjoy :)

## General

This release focuses on supporting runes introduced in Season of Discovery.

Supported runes are listed here https://github.com/ennvina/spellactivationoverlay/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asod

Many runes haven't been tested thoroughly, please keep in mind this is a **beta** version of the addon. Make sure to report issues and suggestions over Discord, GitHub, or CurseForge. Thank you for your patience and understanding :)
