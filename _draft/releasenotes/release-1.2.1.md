@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 1.3.0

This release introduces a new system: combat-only abilities. The release also engages in new Season of Discovery content.

## General
### Seasonal
This release bumps TOC file for the new Season of Discovery content.

### Counters
Abilities in the _counters_ category can be classified as 'combat-only'. Their alerts and glowing buttons will fade out after a few seconds after leaving combat.

This setting is targeted at abilities that basically have an infinite duration. They were annoying when commuting or AFK'ing in a capital city, because you got either a visual alert in the middle of the screen, or buttons were glowing, or both. As a result, players either deactivated the effect or played with that annoying effect and eventually ended up _desensitized_.

Please note, if the ability becomes available when out of combat, the alert or glowing button will activate for a few seconds. This helps players who want to engage combat when their favorite spell or ability is ready, but want to be prepared _before_ entering combat. (Note to Burning Crusade players: it doesn't matter whether or not you think you are prepared, for Illidan believes you are not)

## Classes
### :hunter:  Hunter
Flanking Strike (Season of Discovery) is now classified as 'combat-only'. The spell alert and glowing button will fade out after a few seconds after leaving combat.
### :mage~1:  Mage
Heating Up is now classified as 'combat-only'. The spell alert will fade out after a few seconds after leaving combat, much sooner than the previous 30-second limit.
### :paladin:  Paladin
New Glowing Button:
- Exorcism, as combat-only counter
### :priest:  Priest
New Spell Alert:
- Surge of Light (Season of Discovery)

New Glowing Buttons:
- Flash Heal, during Surge of Light (Season of Discovery)
- Smite, during Surge of Light (Season of Discovery)
### :shaman:  Shaman
Molten Blast (Season of Discovery) is now classified as 'combat-only'. The spell alert and glowing button will fade out after a few seconds after leaving combat.

## Bug Fixes
### Counters
Counters were incorrectly flagged as unavailable during the Global Cooldown (Classic Era only).
### :druid:  Druid
Visual timers of Lunar Eclipse and Solar Eclipse (Season of Discovery) should now refresh their duration correctly when gaining a stack.


As always, the latest release is available:
