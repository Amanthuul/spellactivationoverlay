@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 1.4.3

This release focuses on adding effects for Cataclysm and fixing issues.

## Classes
### :hunter:  Hunter
New Glowing Button:
- Kill Command, during Killing Streak (Cataclysm)
### :priest:  Priest
New Glowing Button:
- Mind Blast, with 2 stacks of Mind Melt (Cataclysm)
### :warrior:  Warrior
New Glowing Buttons:
- Cleave, during Battle Trance (Cataclysm)
- Heroic Strike, during Battle Trance (Cataclysm)

## Bug Fixes
### Spell Alerts
Spell Alerts should no longer display a visual timer shorter than intended.

Combat-only Spell Alerts should no longer flicker when entering combat.
### Options
Glowing button settings are more visible when there are more than 12 buttons in the options panel.
### :mage~1:  Mage
Texture orientation for Frozen debuff was incorrect (Cataclysm).

Improved Cone of Cold and Ring of Frost's freezing property now trigger the Frozen debuff effect (Cataclysm).

Arcane Potency at 1 stack did not fade out after combat (Cataclysm).
### :warlock:  Warlock
Backdraft should now be triggered correctly (Cataclysm).

## Known Issues
Hovering the mouse over the following glowing buttons in options does not preview the glow effect in the action bar:
- Mage's Pyroblast! (Cataclysm)
- Priest's Flash Heal (Cataclysm)
