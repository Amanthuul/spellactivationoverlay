# SpellActivationOverlay 2.0

@here I am CATACLYSMICALLY pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, the new major version: 2.0!  :tada:

This release marks a major overhaul of the effect system. Unless you're playing Death Knight or Paladin, you should not see any significant difference at first. In the near future, it will introduce effects that would have been very tedious to design otherwise. Make sure to report issues you would encounter, thank you  :pray:
## General
The effect system has been completely redesigned. Existing effects should be identical to what they were before.
## Classes
### :dk:  Death Knight
New Glowing Button:
- Bone Shield, when the buff is missing (Cataclysm)
### :paladin:  Paladin
New Spell Alert:
- Charges of Holy Power (Cataclysm)

New Glowing Buttons for Holy Power spenders, when at 3 charges of Holy Power (Cataclysm):
- Word of Glory
- Light of Dawn
- Shield of the Righteous
- Templar's Verdict
- Inquisition
## Bug Fixes
### Spell Alert
Buffs should now be detected a bit more efficiently (Season of Discovery).
### Options
Checking a checkbox in options panel refreshes their effects immediately.
## Known Issues
Although the options panel now refreshes effects immediately, some rare effects still do not refresh immediately after changing their option.

Effects gained or lost during a loading screen may not be correctly updated when loading screen ends. This will be fixed in the next release.
### :priest:  Priest
Mind Spike overlay is blue-ish instead of purple-ish (Season of Discovery). This will be fixed in the next release.
