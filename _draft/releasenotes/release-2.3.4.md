# SpellActivationOverlay 2.3.4
Hi, it's been a while! @here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.3.4

This is a minor release for updating to newest patch versions, with small bug fixes. New effects will be added in the next release, for both Season of Discovery and Cataclysm. Stay tuned!
## General
This release bumps TOC file for Anniversary patch (Classic Era) and Firelands patch (Cataclysm).
## Bug Fixes
### :warlock:  Necrosis
Loading both SpellActivationOverlay and Necrosis could cause a Lua error.
Necrosis has been updated as well. Players who use Necrosis are encouraged to update it.
### Options
The correct size of "Toggle Test" button has been restored.
### User Interface
The last version (2.3.3) could taint the User Interface and sometimes prevent users from clicking some action buttons, such as quest buttons. This was harmless most of the time, and this affected only Cataclysm users with version 2.3.3, which could be downloaded from Discord or Github. CurseForge users were unaffected, simply because there was no release of version 2.3.3 for Cataclysm on CurseForge.

As always, the latest release is available:
