# SpellActivationOverlay 2.4.1
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.4.1

Shout-out to Flow who designed Shaman's 6-10 Maelstrom Weapon textures. Thanks!
## General
This release introduces a new flavor: Mists of Pandaria!  :person_in_lotus_position:

The addon is still in very early stage. The Death Knight is fully supported. Other classes will be covered in the near future. Stay tuned!

There were significant changes which, hopefully, should not break anything. But in case it did break something, please to report issues. Thank you :slight_smile:
