# SpellActivationOverlay 2.4.2
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.4.2
## General
## Classes
### :dk:  Death Knight
New Glowing Button
- Death Strike, during Glyph of Dark Succor (Cataclysm)

Death Strike is already glowing as intended for Mists of Pandaria
## Bug Fixes
### General
Glowing Buttons from this addon no longer conflict with buttons glowing by the game client
### :dk:  Death Knight
Dark Tranformation
- Now displays the overlay as intended (Mists of Pandaria)
- The overlay is already working as intended for Cataclysm

Glyph of Dark Succor
- Death Strike button only glows in Frost/Unholy presence (Mists of Pandaria)
- The issue was limited to Mists of Pandaria because the glyph was tracked only for this expansion
- Glyph of Dark Succor is now also implemented in Cataclysm, which also benefits from this fix
## Known Limitations
## Miscellaneous
The flavor icon of Classic Era is now an ice cream, in reference to the first Classic announcement at BlizzCon 2017.
