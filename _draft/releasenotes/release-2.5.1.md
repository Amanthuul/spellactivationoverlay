# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.1
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.1
## General
## Classes
### :priest:  Priest
New Glowing Button
- Devouring Plague, at 3 Shadow Orbs (Mists of Pandaria)

Although the game client already glows the button of Devouring Plague at 3 Shadow Orbs, it has some flaws:
- It only lets the button glow for up to 30 seconds, probably to avoid buttons constantly glowing while AFK
- Devouring Plague does not glow when the Priest got the 3rd shadow orb from the new functionality that grants an orb every 6 seconds out of combat

The addon solves both issues by setting Devouring Plague as _combat-only_.
## Bug Fixes
## Known Limitations
### :priest:  Priest
Because the game client glows Devouring Plague for 30 seconds, the button will keep glowing even when the Priest leaves combat, up until 30 seconds after getting/refreshing the 3rd orb (or up until Devouring Plague is cast, obviously).
