# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.2
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.2
## General
## Classes
### :hunter:  Hunter
The Hunter class is now fully supported for Mists of Pandaria!

New Spell Alerts
- Master Marksman (Mists of Pandaria)
- Lock and Load (Mists of Pandaria)
- Thrill of the Hunt (Mists of Pandaria)

Updated Spell Alert
- Lock and Load is slightly dimmer at 1 stack, to indicate that there the next Shot will consume the last stack (Wrath, Cataclysm)
## Bug Fixes
### :hunter:  Hunter
Lock and Load no longer plays a sound when dropping from 2 stacks to 1 stack, because there is no new 'proc' (Wrath, Cataclysm).

_Developer's Note: Sounds should indicate something new and hardly controllable by the player has happened, to tell them "Now would be a good time to cast this ability that you maybe wouldn't have cast otherwise". When the player consumes a charge on purpose, there is no point in triggering the sound. At best, it's a distraction (pun intended). At worst, it is misleading players that stacks were refreshed, which they were not._
