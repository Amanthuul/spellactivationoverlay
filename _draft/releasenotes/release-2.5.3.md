# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.3
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.3
## General
### SpellActivationOverlay vs. SpellActivationOverlay
The game's spell alert options are now checked at start (Mists of Pandaria). When you log in for the first time, you will be asked to disable the game's spell alert to avoid conflicts. Considering the game's spell alerts currently have many issues, it is best to disable them for now.
### Contribution
Starting today, up until the pre-patch of Mists of Pandaria, spell alerts that are seen in-game but unknown to the addon will be reported to the game chat.

You are encouraged to report them. You can post them anywhere you like: Discord server, Github issues, or CurseForge comments. Initiatives like these will help prepare the addon as best as we can for Mists of Pandaria. Thank you in advance for your help :)

These messages are enabled by default. They can be disabled in the options panel.
## Classes
### :monk:  Monk
The Monk class is now supported!

Spell Alerts
- Combo Breaker: Blackout Kick
- Combo Breaker: Tiger Palm
## Bug Fixes
## Known Limitations
## Internationalization
The Traditional Chinese language (zh-TW) is now fully supported. Previously, Traditional Chinese would fall back to Simplified Chinese when the translation was missing.

_Developer's Note: Debug messages are never translated. It would require too much work, not to mention it would make the addon significantly bigger, would use more memory, and would be slower to load. Necrosis warnings are also not translated for pretty much the same reasons._
## Miscellaneous
The addon flavor is now displayed in the options panel. Additionally, players are warned when they install the wrong flavor for their game client.
