# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.4
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.4
## General
## Classes
### :warrior:  Warrior
The Warrior class is now fully supported for Mists of Pandaria!

New Spell Alerts
- Victory Rush (Mists of Pandaria)
- Taste for Blood (Mists of Pandaria)
- Sudden Death (Mists of Pandaria)
- Bloodsurge (Mists of Pandaria)
- Sword and Board (Mists of Pandaria)
- Ultimatum (Mists of Pandaria)

New Glowing Buttons
- Overpower\*, during Taste for Blood (Mists of Pandaria)
- Victory Rush\*, during Victorious (Mists of Pandaria)
- Impending Victory, during Victorious (Mists of Pandaria)

\* Overpower and Victory Rush were already supported, but as a _counter_. Now they are based on buffs instead. They also have spell alerts now. If these overlays are popular enough, they might end up in other flavors as well.

Removed Glowing Buttons\*\*
- Execute (Mists of Pandaria)
- Revenge (Mists of Pandaria)

\*\* These buttons already glow natively in Mists of Pandaria
