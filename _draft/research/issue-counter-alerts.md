## Suggestions

### Death Knight

Rune Strike could use `bandits_guile` at top position, similar to Rogue's Riposte, but with a smaller size to avoid overlap.

### Hunter

Counterattack could use `bandits_guile` at top position, similar to Rogue's Riposte, but with a smaller size to avoid overlap.

Kill Shot could use `focus_fire` at top position.

Mongoose Bite could use `white_tiger` at top position.

Note: because Kill Shot is available in Wrath only and Mongoose Bite is available in Era only, both could coexist at the same location without overlapping with each other.

### Paladin

Hammer of Wrath could use `hand_of_light` or `denounce` (maybe as an option?) at top position.

Exorcism (#209) and Divine Storm (#210) TBD.

### Warrior

Overpower could use `bandits_guile` at top position, similar to Rogue's Riposte, but with a smaller size to avoid overlap.

Execute could use `sudden_death` at left/right position, similar to Sudden Death, either with a smaller size to avoid overlap, or with normal size to overlap with Suddden Death (Wrath issue only). Maybe the best would probably be to overlap anyway. It might look a bit weird, but it would be even weird-er to repeat the texture with different sizes.

Revenge could use `ultimatum` at top position, with a small risk of overlapping with Sudden Death (Wrath issue only).

Victory Rush could use `dark_tiger` at left/right position, with a higher size to avoir overlap and smaller opacity to make it not too visible.
